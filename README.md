# LSPD-optimization
Code optimizations for Little Sunny Paws Daycare version 3.5.0.3, focusing on removing and condensing reduntant code from game scripts. Developers of the game or other projects, feel free to use these files as you wish.

The text in 'useful functions.aslx' should be copied into the functions tree of the game aslx (via Quest's codeview). This contains functions for tasks commonly done throughout the game. (currently, just for keeping stats within a certain range)
